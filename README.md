# astro_utils

A collection of utility functions and notebooks developed for my M. Sc. thesis to quickly perform several operations with astronomical observations.

* tfm_utils: Originally developed to work with ALMA datacubes and integrated emission maps produced with MADCUBA using Jupyter notebooks.
* prac_utils: Originally developed to work with Yebes 40m spectra.
